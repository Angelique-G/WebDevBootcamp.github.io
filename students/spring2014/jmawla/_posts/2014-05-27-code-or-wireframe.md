If you're a programmer, chances are you will jump into coding right away and maybe designing in code sounds like quick solution in the begining but as the project gets bigger, it will move toward disoriented mode. To solve this issue from the start, websites should be desinged with wireframes. Wireframes will help arranging all different elements in a website nicely in order to accomplish best design in user's mind.
Wireframes should be done first.
